# Geldium AI-Powered Collections Strategy - Project Documentation

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates the development of an AI-powered collections strategy for Geldium, a financial services company. The analysis spans four key phases: exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, business strategy development, and implementation planning.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective**: Comprehensive analysis of customer financial data to identify risk patterns and data quality issues.

**Key Findings**:
- **Dataset**: 502 customer records with 15 features
- **Missing Data**: 12% missing values in income field
- **Key Risk Indicators**: 
  - Credit utilization ratio (correlation: 0.45)
  - Account tenure (correlation: -0.38)
  - Credit score (correlation: -0.35)
- **Data Quality**: Good overall quality with manageable missing data

**Deliverables**:
- EDA analysis script (`eda_analysis.py`)
- Comprehensive EDA report (`eda_summary_report.txt`)
- Data visualizations (correlation matrix)
- Data quality assessments

### Phase 2: Predictive Modeling

**Objective**: Develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of delinquency.

**Methodology**:
- **Model Type**: Logistic Regression (chosen for interpretability and regulatory compliance)
- **Feature Engineering**: Correlation-based feature selection
- **Evaluation Metrics**: AUC-ROC, F1-score, precision, recall
- **Ethical Considerations**: Bias detection and fairness monitoring

**Key Results**:
- **Top Predictors**: Credit utilization, account tenure, credit score
- **Model Performance**: AUC-ROC of 0.78
- **High-Risk Segments**: Customers with >80% credit utilization

**Deliverables**:
- Predictive modeling script (`model_analysis.py`)
- Model analysis report (`summary-report.txt`)
- Feature importance rankings
- Risk factor analysis

### Phase 3: Business Strategy Development

**Objective**: Translate technical insights into actionable business recommendations.

**Strategic Recommendations**:
- **Target Segment**: High credit utilization customers (>80%)
- **Intervention Strategy**: Personalized payment plans and credit counseling
- **Implementation Timeline**: 30-day rollout
- **Expected Impact**: 25% reduction in delinquency rates

**Ethical Framework**:
- Fairness across demographic segments
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Responsible AI implementation
- Human oversight for critical decisions

**Deliverables**:
- Business insights report (`summary-report.txt`)
- SMART recommendation framework
- Ethical AI guidelines

### Phase 4: Implementation Strategy

**Objective**: Design comprehensive AI-powered collections system architecture.

**System Architecture**:
- **Hybrid Model**: Human-AI collaboration with oversight
- **Automated Actions**: Payment reminders, basic interventions
- **Human Review**: Complex cases, hardship assessments
- **Learning Loop**: Continuous model improvement

**Responsible AI Implementation**:
- **Fairness Checks**: Regular bias testing
- **Explainability**: Clear reasoning for decisions
- **Compliance**: GDPR, ECOA, and local regulations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

**Business Impact**:
- **Quantitative**: 25% improvement in collection rates, 40% efficiency gains
- **Qualitative**: Enhanced customer experience, improved fairness

**Deliverables**:
- Executive presentation (`ai-powered-collections-strategy.pptx`)
- Implementation roadmap
- Technical specifications
