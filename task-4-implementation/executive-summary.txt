EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: AI-Powered Collections Strategy
Geldium Financial Services

================================================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================
Geldium faces challenges in managing delinquency risk across its customer portfolio while maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance. Current manual processes are inefficient, inconsistent, and unable to scale with business growth. The company needs a solution that can:
‚Ä¢ Proactively identify at-risk customers before delinquency occurs
‚Ä¢ Provide personalized, fair interventions based on individual circumstances
‚Ä¢ Scale operations without proportional cost increases
‚Ä¢ Maintain regulatory compliance and ethical standards

================================================================================
PROPOSED SOLUTION
================================================================================
AI-Powered Collections System with Human Oversight

Our proposed solution leverages agentic AI to create a scalable, fair, and effective debt management system that combines the power of machine learning with human judgment and oversight.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. **Intelligent Risk Assessment**: Logistic regression model using 5 key features (Income, Account Tenure, Credit Score, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Credit Utilization) to predict delinquency risk
2. **Automated Intervention System**: Risk-based segmentation with personalized outreach strategies
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Oversight**: Critical decisions require human review and approval
4. **Responsible AI Framework**: Comprehensive guardrails for fairness, explainability, and compliance
