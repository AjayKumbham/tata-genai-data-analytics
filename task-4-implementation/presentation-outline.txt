• Feature importance transparency showing which factors influenced the decision
• Decision rationale documentation for regulatory audits and customer inquiries
• Regulatory audit trail maintenance for compliance verification
• Model interpretability reports for stakeholder communication

⚖️ REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
• ECOA (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) compliance for fair lending practices
• GDPR data protection standards for customer privacy
• Fair Credit Reporting Act adherence for credit reporting accuracy
• State-specific financial regulations and consumer protection laws
• Regular compliance audits and regulatory reporting

👥 HUMAN OVERSIGHT
